## Motivation

People go to brokers to sell their homes.

Their home gets put up as a listing at that brokerage.

Other brokerages don't get to see this listing.

Unless they use a Major Listing Service (MLS).

However, brokers and brokerages can pay to be members of an MLS to get access to all member listings.

Therefore, I can't list my house on an MLS if I want to sell it, without having a brokerage license OR hiring a broker who is affiliated with an MLS.

## Problem

This is a problem because, as a seller, you are basically forced to sell through an agent and you have to pay a commission to your agent and the buyer's agent.

And that typically accounts for ~5% of the sale price of your home.

These agents are handing out boiler plate documents that can be streamlined without a middle man.

Granted, there is room to ammend these documents during negotiations with buyers and sellers that make it more complicated than simply filling out boiler plate documents, but there can be a better solution to this that doesn't cost ~5% of the seller's home value.

## Solution

We want to build a central hub for buying and selling homes without the middle man through the use of open sourced MLS listings to help sellers get the most value out of their home.
